....branches concept.....
# why we using branches ? 
  - because when we work on the big project we uses branch to avoid the any effect on the main branch if the project is good in working we commit the project in the main branch. 

 ~in the git we can make branches by using the git command 
1. git branch branch_name

 ~ to switch the that branch using the git command is 
2. git checkout branch_name
